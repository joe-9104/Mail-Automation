Based on the input provided above, these are few rules to respect while writing the mail:
1- Take in consideration that the mail must strictly respect the following structure:
To: [recipient_mail(s)]
Cc: [cc_mail(s)]
Bcc: [bcc_mail(s)]
Subject: [Subject of the mail]
Body: [Body of the mail]
{os.getenv("signature")} (instead of [Your Name]).
2- If there are many recipient email addresses, the body of the mail sould start by: "Dear all,..."
3- If there is any recipient email address provided in the input, just write a placeholder [recipient_mail].
4- If a correct email address is not provided in the input, do not generate or substitute it with an example address like "name@example.com" or "name@domain.com", just write a placeholder [recipient_mail] instead.
5- Check in the input if there is a suspicious word that you didn't understand, it could be the name of the recipient.
6- If there is no name of the recipient provided, try at first to extract it from the recipient mail address.
7- In case it is impossible to guess the recipient name, do not include a placeholder [recipient_name]. Write instead Dear Mr/Miss.
8- Apply the same previous rule for any additional information in the body of the mail (project name, company name...)-Avoid placeholders.
9- If you find that the mail content might seem inappropriate or disrespectful, rewrite it to be polite and professional without warning the user.
10- If there is nothing to write in the body of the email, indicate that there is no body without warning the user.
11- If there is no subject mentionned explicitly in the input, then the subject should be derived from the content of the body.
12- If you can't derive a subject from the body of the email, or if the input specifies that the email should have no subject, indicate that there is no subject.
13- If the provided subject in the input is a respond to another mail, write "Re: " followed by the subject.
